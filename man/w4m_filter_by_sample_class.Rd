\arguments{
\item{dataMatrix_in}{see details: data matrix (rows are feature names, columns are sample names}

\item{sampleMetadata_in}{see details: sample metadata (rows are sample names, one column's name matches class_column)}

\item{variableMetadata_in}{see details: variable metadata (rows are variable names)}

\item{dataMatrix_out}{see details: output data matrix (rows are feature names, columns are sample names}

\item{sampleMetadata_out}{see details: output sample metadata (rows are sample names, one column's name matches class_column)}

\item{variableMetadata_out}{see details: output variable metadata (rows are variable names)}

\item{classes}{character array: names of sample classes to include or exclude; default is an empty array}

\item{include}{logical: TRUE, include named sample classes; FALSE (the default), exclude named sample classes}

\item{class_column}{character: name of "class" column, defaults to "class"}

\item{samplename_column}{character: name of column with sample name, defaults to "sampleMetadata"}

\item{data_imputation}{function(m): default imputation method for 'intb' data, where intensities have background subtracted - impute zero for NA}

\item{failure_action}{function(x, ...): action to take upon failure - defaults to 'print(x,...)'}

logical: TRUE only if filtration succeeded

\description{
Filter a set of retention-corrected W4M files (dataMatrix, sampleMetadata, variableMetadata) by sample-class
}
\details{
The W4M files dataMatrix, sampleMetadata, and variableMetadata must be a consistent set, i.e.,
there must be metadata in the latter two files for all (and only for) the samples and variables named in the columns and rows of dataMatrix.

For multivariate statistics functions, samples and variables with zero variance must be eliminated, and missing values are problematic.

Furthermore, frequently, it is desirable to analyze a subset of samples (or features) in the dataMatrix.

This function manipulates produces a set of files with imputed missing values, omitting features and samples that are not consistently present within the set or have zero variance.
It also provides a selection-capability for samples based on whether their sample names match a regular expression pattern; this capability can be used either to select for samples with matching sample names or to exclude them.

Inputs (dataMatrix_in, sampleMetadata_in, variableMetadata_in) may be:
\itemize{
\item character: path to input tab-separated-values-file (TSV)
\item data.frame
\item matrix: allowed for dataMatrix_in only
\item list: must have a member named "dataMatrix", "sampleMetadata", or "variableMetadata" for dataMatrix_in, sampleMetadata_in, or variableMetadata_in, respectively.
\item environment: must have a member named "dataMatrix", "sampleMetadata", or "variableMetadata" for dataMatrix_in, sampleMetadata_in, or variableMetadata_in, respectively.
}

Outputs (dataMatrix_out, sampleMetadata_out, variableMetadata_out) may be:
\itemize{
\item character: path to write a tab-separated-values-file (TSV)
\item list: will add a member named "dataMatrix", "sampleMetadata", or "variableMetadata" for dataMatrix_out, sampleMetadata_out, or variableMetadata_out, respectively.
\item environment: will add a member named "dataMatrix", "sampleMetadata", or "variableMetadata" for dataMatrix_out, sampleMetadata_out, or variableMetadata_out, respectively.
}
