### Purpose of the `w4mclassfilter` package

The purpose of the 
[w4mclassfilter](https://github.com/HegemanLab/w4mclassfilter) 
R package is to provide the computational back-end of a 
[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) 
tool for inclusion in 
[Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M)](http://workflow4metabolomics.org/).

This package (and the Galaxy tool) perform several steps to address several
data issues that may impede or thwart downstream statistical analysis:

* Samples that are missing from either `sampleMetadata` or `dataMatrix` are eliminated.
* Samples may also be eliminated by a "sample class" column in `sampleMetadata`.
* Features that are missing from either `variableMetadata` or `dataMatrix` are eliminated.
* Features may also be eliminated by specifying ranges of allowable values in columns of `variableMetadata`.
* Missing values in `dataMatrix` are imputed to zero (by default) or with a user-supplied imputation function.
* Features and samples that have zero variance are eliminated.

### How the `w4m_filter_by_sample_class` function is used

A Galaxy tool wrapper invokes `w4m_filter_by_sample_class`.  For exploratory or
debugging purposes, the package may be installed loaded into R and help may 
then be obtained with the following command:

```r
?w4mclassfilter::w4m_filter_by_sample_class
```

W4M uses the XCMS and CAMERA packages to preprocess GC-MS or LC-MS data, 
producing three files (which are documented in detail on the 
[Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M)](http://workflow4metabolomics.org/) web site).  
In summary:

1. `sampleMetadata.tsv`: a tab-separated file with metadata for the samples, 
   one line per sample

  + One column of this file indicates the *class* of the sample.
  + It is the class that is used by this function to determine whether to 
    include the sample in, or exclude the sample from, further analysis.

2. `variableMetadata.tsv`: a tab-separated file with metadata for the features
   detected, one line per feature

  + A feature is a location in the two dimensional space defined by the GC-MS
    or LC-MS data set, which corresponds to a compound or a group of compounds.
  + One dimension is the mass-to-charge ratio, `m/z`.
  + The other dimension is the `retention time`, i.e., how long until the
    solvent gradient eluted the compound(s) from the column.

3. `dataMatrix.tsv`: a tab separated file with the MS intensities for each
   sample for each feature:

  + There is one column per sample.
  + There is one row per feature.
  + If a feature is missing for a sample, the intensity value is `NA`.
  + For numerical reasons, intenisities may be negative, but this has no
    meaning in the real world.


When `w4m_filter_by_sample_class` completes running, it writes out updated
`sampleMetadata.tsv`, `variableMetadata.tsv`, and `dataMatrix.tsv` files.
The paths to the output files *must* be different from the paths to the 
input files.

#### Input- and Output-Format

Galaxy presents datasets to tools as files; because of this, ordinary usage of the
`w4mclassfilter::w4m_filter_by_sample_class` method is to read from and write to 
tab-delimited flat files (TSVs).  However, because general-purpose R packages 
usually use data structures in memory for their input and output, 
`w4m_filter_by_sample_class` can interface not only with TSVs but also with data
structures (data.frame and matrix); see 'New in release v0.98.3' below.

#### Feature- and Sample-Elimination

When `w4m_filter_by_sample_class` is invoked:
  * an array of class names may be supplied in the `classes` argument.
    If the `include` argument is true, then only samples whose *class* column in 
    `sampleMetadata` (as named in the `class_column` argument) will 
    be *included in* the output; by contrast, if the `include` argument is false,
    then only samples whose *class* column in `sampleMetadata`
    will be *excluded from* the output.
  * an array of range specifications may be supplied in the `variable_range_filter`
    argument.  If supplied, only features having values in the specified column
    of `variableMetadata` that fall within the specified ranges will be retained
    in the output.  Each range is a string of three colon-separated values in the
    following order:
      - the name of a column of `variableMetadata` which must have numerical data;
      - the minimum allowed value in that column for the feature to be retained;
      - the maximum allowed value.

Even if no rows or columns of the input `dataMatrix` input have zero variance,
there is the possibility that eliminating samples or features may result in some 
rows or columns having zero variance, adversely impacting downstream statistical
analysis.  Consequently, `w4m_filter_by_sample_class` eliminates these rows or
columns and the corresponding rows from `sampleMetadata`,
`variableMetadata`, and `dataMatrix`.

#### Imputation of Missing Values

The `w4mclassfilter::w4m_filter_imputation` function is the default imputation 
method used by `w4m_filter_by_sample_class`; if other methods are to be used 
in the Galaxy tool, they might best be incorporated into the `w4mclassfilter` 
R package, although they could be implemented in another R package to be used 
by the Galaxy tool. 

By default, the `w4m_filter_by_sample_class` function imputes negative and
`NA` intensity values as zero using the following `w4m_filter_imputation` function.

```r
w4m_filter_imputation <- 
  function(m) {
    # replace NA values with zero
    m[is.na(m)] <- 0
    # replace negative values with zero, if applicable (It should never be applicable!)
    m[m<0] <- 0
    # return matrix as the result
    return (m)
  }
```

### New in release v0.98.2 - support regular expressions

Beginning with v0.98.2, w4mclassfilter supports use of R regular expression patterns to select class-names.

The R `base::grepl` function (at the core of this functionality) uses POSIX 1003.2 standard regular expressions, which allow precise pattern-matching and are exhaustively defined at: [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1\_chap09.html](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html)

However, only a few basic building blocks of regular expressions need to be mastered for most cases:

* `^` matches the beginning of a class-name
* `$` matches the end of a class-name
* `.` outside of square brackets matches a single character
* `*` matches character specified immediately before zero or more times
* square brackets specify a set of characters to be matched.

Within square brackets

* `^` as the first character specifies that the list of characters are those that should * not * be matched.
* `-` is used to specify ranges of characters

Caveat: The tool wrapper uses the comma (`,`) to split a list of sample-class names, so *commas may not be used within regular expressions for this tool*

First Example: Consider a field of class-names consisting of 
```
marq3,marq6,marq9,marq12,front3,front6,front9,front12
```

| this regular expression | matches this set of sample-class names |
| :--- | :--- |
| `^front[0-9][0-9]*$` | "front3,front6,front9,front12" |
| `^[a-z][a-z]3$`      | "front3,marq3" |
| `^[a-z][a-z]12$`     | "front12,marq12" |
| `^[a-z][a-z][0-9]$`  | "front3,front6,front9,marq3,marq6,marq9" |

Second Example: Consider these regular expression patterns as possible matches to a sample-class name 'AB0123':

| this regular expression | matches this set of sample-class names |
| :--- | :--- | 
| `^[A-Z][A-Z][0-9][0-9]*$` | `AB0123`  |
| `^[A-Z][A-Z]*[0-9][0-9]*$` | `AB0123`  |
| `^[A-Z][0-9]*` | `AB0123`, see note 1. |
| `^[A-Z][A-Z][0-9]` | `AB0123`, see note 2. |
| `^[A-Z][A-Z]*[0-9][0-9]$` | NO MATCH, see note 3. |
| `^[A-Z][0-9]*$` | NO MATCH, see note 4. |


1. The first character is a letter, `*` can specify zero characters, and end of line did not need to be matched. 
2. The first two characters are letters aind the third is a digit. 
3. The name does not end with the pattern `[A-Z][0-9][0-9]$`, i.e., it ends with four digits, not two.
4. The pattern specifies that second character and all those that follow, if present, must be digits.

### New in release v0.98.3 - more flexible input and output

  - else if a matrix, use directly
  - else error
  
2. `sampleMetadata_in`

  - if a string, treat as a file path (i.e., same as in previous releases)
