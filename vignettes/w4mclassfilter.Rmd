### Purpose of the `w4mclassfilter` package

The purpose of the 
[w4mclassfilter](https://github.com/HegemanLab/w4mclassfilter) 
R package is to provide the computational back-end of a 
[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) 
tool for inclusion in 
[Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M)](http://workflow4metabolomics.org/).

Galaxy tools are file-oriented; because of this, the 
`w4mclassfilter::w4m_filter_by_sample_class` method reads from and writes to 
files.  General-purpose R packages usually use data structures in memory for 
their input and output, which may mean that this R package is not generally 
useful outside of the context of Galaxy.

The `w4mclassfilter::w4m_filter_imputation` function is the default imputation 
method used by `w4m_filter_by_sample_class`; if other methods are to be used 
in the Galaxy tool, they might best be incorporated into the `w4mclassfilter` 
R package, although they could be implemented in another R package to be used 
by the Galaxy tool.

### How the `w4m_filter_by_sample_class` function is used

A Galaxy tool wrapper invokes `w4m_filter_by_sample_class`.  For exploratory or
debugging purposes, the package may be installed loaded into R and help may 
then be obtained with the following command:

```?w4mclassfilter::w4m_filter_by_sample_class```


W4M uses the XCMS and CAMERA packages to preprocess GC-MS or LC-MS data, 
producing three files (which are documented in detail on the 
[Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M)](http://workflow4metabolomics.org/) web site).  
In summary:

1. `sampleMetadata.tsv`: a tab-separated file with metadata for the samples, 
   one line per sample

  + One column of this file indicates the *class* of the sample.
  + It is the class that is used by this function to determine whether to 
    include the sample in, or exclude the sample from, further analysis.

2. `variableMetadata.tsv`: a tab-separated file with metadata for the features
   detected, one line per feature

  + A feature is a location in the two dimensional space defined by the GC-MS
    or LC-MS data set, which corresponds to a compound or a group of compounds.
  + One dimension is the mass-to-charge ratio, `m/z`.
  + The other dimension is the `retention time`, i.e., how long until the
    solvent gradient eluted the compound(s) from the column.

3. `dataMatrix.tsv`: a tab separated file with the MS intensities for each
   sample for each feature:

  + There is one column per sample.
  + There is one row per feature.
  + If a feature is missing for a sample, the intensity value is `NA`.
  + For numerical reasons, intenisities may be negative, but this has no
    meaning in the real world.

By default, the `w4m_filter_by_sample_class` function imputes negative and
`NA` intensity values as zero using the `w4m_filter_imputation` function.

When `w4m_filter_by_sample_class` is invoked, an array of class names is
supplied in the `classes` argument.  If the `include` argument is true,
then only samples whose *class* column in  `sampleMetadata.tsv` will be
*included in* the output; by contrast, if the `include` argument is false,
then only samples whose *class* column in `sampleMetadata.tsv` will 
be *excluded from* the output.

Even if no rows or columns of the `dataMatrix.tsv` input have zero variance,
there is the possibility that eliminating samples may result in some rows or
columns having zero variance, adversely impacting downstream statistical
analysis.  Consequently, `w4m_filter_by_sample_class` eliminates these rows or
columns and the corresponding rows from `sampleMetadata.tsv` and
`variableMetadata.tsv`.

When `w4m_filter_by_sample_class` completes running, it writes out updated
`sampleMetadata.tsv`, `variableMetadata.tsv`, and `dataMatrix.tsv` files.
The paths to the output files *must* be different from the paths to the 
input files.

### New in release v0.98.2 - support regular expressions

Beginning with v0.98.2, w4mclassfilter supports use of R regular expression patterns to select class-names.

The R `base::grepl` function (at the core of this functionality) uses POSIX 1003.2 standard regular expressions, which allow precise pattern-matching and are exhaustively defined at: [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1\_chap09.html](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html)

However, only a few basic building blocks of regular expressions need to be mastered for most cases:

* `^` matches the beginning of a class-name
* `$` matches the end of a class-name
* `.` outside of square brackets matches a single character
* `*` matches character specified immediately before zero or more times
* square brackets specify a set of characters to be matched.

Within square brackets

* `^` as the first character specifies that the list of characters are those that should * not * be matched.
* `-` is used to specify ranges of characters

Caveat: The tool wrapper uses the comma (`,`) to split a list of sample-class names, so *commas may not be used within regular expressions for this tool*

First Example: Consider a field of class-names consisting of 
```marq3,marq6,marq9,marq12,front3,front6,front9,front12```

* The regular expression `^front[0-9][0-9]*$` will match the same sample-classes as `front3,front6,front9,front12`
* The regular expression `^[a-z][a-z]3$` will match the same sample-classes as `front3,marq3`
* The regular expression `^[a-z][a-z]12$` will match the same sample-classes as `front12,marq12`
* The regular expression `^[a-z][a-z][0-9]$` will match the same sample-classes as `front3,front6,front9,marq3,marq6,marq9`

Second Example: Consider these regular expression patterns as possible matches to a sample-class name 'AB0123':

* `^[A-Z][A-Z][0-9][0-9]*$` - MATCHES `**^AB0123$**`
* `^[A-Z][A-Z]*[0-9][0-9]*$` - MATCHES `**^AB0123$**`
* `^[A-Z][0-9]*` - MATCHES `**^A** B0123$` (The first character is a letter, `*` can specify zero characters, and end of line did not need to be matched.)
* `^[A-Z][A-Z][0-9]` - MATCHES `**^AB0** 123$` (The first two characters are letters aind the third is a digit.)
* `^[A-Z][A-Z]*[0-9][0-9]$` - NO MATCH (The name does not end with the pattern `[A-Z][0-9][0-9]$`, i.e., it ends with four digits, not two.)
* `^[A-Z][0-9]*$` - NO MATCH (The pattern specifies that second character and all those that follow, if present, must be digits.)
